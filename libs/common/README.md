# Common Library

  - **types.ts**: Contains common TypeScript types used throughout the application.
  - **utils.ts**: Contains utility functions that can be reused across services.

## Usage

To use the common library in your service, import the necessary types or utility functions as needed. This promotes code reusability and consistency across the application.
